<!--Life and Legend-->
    <p style="text-indent: 15px; width:600px"> Neil Young was born November 12, 1945 in Toronto, Ontario to Rassy
        and Scott Young. As a youth, he survived diabetes, polio, epilepsy and the
        divorce of his parents. His father was a highly respected sportswriter for
        The Toronto Sun and has authored several books, including Neil & Me,
        a 1984 title covering his relationship with his musician son.

        After embarking on a music career in the 1960s, he moved to Los Angeles, joining
        Buffalo Springfield with Stephen Stills, Richie Furay and others. Since his early
        solo albums and those with his backing band Crazy Horse, Young has been prolific,
        recording a steady stream of studio and live albums.Young has received several 
        Grammy and Juno Awards. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted him twice: 
        in 1995 as a solo artist and in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield. In 2000, 
        Rolling Stone named Young the 34th greatest rock 'n roll artist. His guitar work, 
        deeply personal lyrics and signature tenor singing voice define his long career.
